# Hitchmap

The map to hitchhiking the world. Read more [here](https://hitchwiki.org/en/Hitchwiki:Maps).


## Description

Hitchmap is a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) that runs every few minutes.

- `server.py` runs the server
- `scripts/show.py` builds the main HTML page (`index.html`). This is where the magic happens.
- `scripts/dump.py` runs the monthly dump
- `cron.sh` is the crontab running above files
- `hitchmap.conf` is the NGINX configuration
- `js/map.js` is the entry point of the homepage's JavaScript
- `js/pending.js` is responsible for adding temporary markers

A few developers have taken it upon themselves to rewrite Hitchmap to a more traditional MVC structure.

For contributors and users, we recommend reviewing both repositories to determine which best fits your needs. In virtually all cases, user-facing contributions will eventually end up in both repositories.
